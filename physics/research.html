<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ How to Make an Unstable Physics Engine ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h1>How to Make an Unstable Physics Engine</h1>
<p>Main demo <a href="./index.html">here</a></p>
<p><a href="./physics.js">physics.js</a> is a physics engine I'm making. This
page covers the main pieces someone might be interested in learning from.
Lessons learned concerning stability and performance that are buried in larger
engines.</p>


<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Collisions ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h1>Collisions</h1>
<!--<h2>Collisions</h2>-->
<p>The engine is based around simulating everything with atoms and bonds, which
means that collisions would form the core of the engine and that it was
important I get them right. A bit of research turned up results to just use
ready-made engines, and a bit more research turned up basic elastic collision
equations, like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision#Two-dimensional">wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>This is what the simulation looks like when implementing the equations as
they're written:</p>
<table class="demotable">
<tr><td></td>
<td style="width:33%;padding:1rem;">
<canvas id="stackcanv00" style="margin:auto;"></canvas></td>
<td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Simulation grade. The problem is that the equations are modeled after
reality, which effectively has an infinitely small timestep, and we can't
simulate that in any reasonable timeframe. Our simulation will have to make do
with the large timesteps we give it.</p>
<p>This is the pseudocode the simulation is using, implementing real-world
equations:</p>
<div class="codeblock langjs">function collideatoms(a,b) {
	// Determine if the atoms are overlapping.
	let norm=b.pos-a.pos;
	let dist=norm*norm;
	let rad=a.rad+b.rad;
	if (dist>=rad*rad) {return;}
	dist=Math.sqrt(dist);
	norm/=dist;
	// Get relative masses.
	let mass=a.mass+b.mass;
	let amass=a.mass/mass;
	let bmass=b.mass/mass;
	// Get the relative velocity.
	let elasticity=1.98;
	let posdif=rad-dist;
	let veldif=norm*(a.vel-b.vel)*elasticity;
	// Push the atoms apart.
	a.pos-=norm*(posdif*bmass);
	a.vel-=norm*(veldif*bmass);
	b.pos+=norm*(posdif*amass);
	b.vel+=norm*(veldif*amass);
}
</div>
<p>The problem with the stack of atoms collapsing together occurs because the
atoms never get the chance to fully separate. Our engine applies the collision
equations whenever the atoms are colliding, but those equations only make sense
if the atoms are traveling <b>towards</b> each other. Our stack is so dense that
atoms can stay overlapping each other even though their velocities should
separate them.</p>
<p>The fix, pretty simply, is to ignore the velocity component when the atoms
are already traveling away from each other. The only modification needed is to
the <i>veldif</i> equation.</p>
<div class="codeblock langjs">let veldif=norm*(a.vel-b.vel);
veldif=max(veldif,0)*elasticity;
</div>
<p>With this we can see a pretty noticeable improvement:</p>
<table class="demotable">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td style="width:33%;padding:1rem;">
<canvas id="stackcanv01" style="margin:auto;"></canvas></td>
<td style="width:33%;padding:1rem;">
<canvas id="stackcanv10" style="margin:auto;"></canvas></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td style="padding:1.5rem;padding-top:0;"><i>veldif</i></td>
<td style="padding:1.5rem;padding-top:0;"><i>max(veldif,0)</i></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The stack still looks a little too crushed at the bottom. Even if this is
reflective of high pressures in the real world, the engine isn't really applying
pressure to the bottom of the stack. The volatile movement is mostly being
caused by the atoms pushing each other's positions away from each other. We need
a way for that change in position to result in a change in velocity to allow the
bottom to build up pressure and press up against gravity. The modification is
once again to <i>veldif</i> by adding <i>posdif</i> to it</p>
<div class="codeblock langjs">let posdif=rad-dist;
let veldif=norm*(a.vel-b.vel);
veldif=max(veldif,0)*elasticity+posdif;
</div>
<p>With this we finally have a stack that can support itself.</p>
<table class="demotable">
<tr>
<td style="width:33%;padding:1rem;">
<canvas id="stackcanv02" style="margin:auto;"></canvas></td>
<td style="width:33%;padding:1rem;">
<canvas id="stackcanv11" style="margin:auto;"></canvas></td>
<td style="width:33%;padding:1rem;">
<canvas id="stackcanv20" style="margin:auto;"></canvas></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding:1.5rem;padding-top:0;"><i>veldif</i></td>
<td style="padding:1.5rem;padding-top:0;"><i>max(veldif,0)</i></td>
<td style="padding:1.5rem;padding-top:0;"><i>max(veldif,0) + posdif</i></td>
</tr>
</table>
<script>
new StackScene(["stackcanv00","stackcanv01","stackcanv02"],0);
new StackScene(["stackcanv10","stackcanv11"],1);
new StackScene(["stackcanv20"],2);
</script>
<p>The final corrected function is:</p>
<div class="codeblock langjs">function collideatoms(a,b) {
	// Determine if the atoms are overlapping.
	let norm=b.pos-a.pos;
	let dist=norm*norm;
	let rad=a.rad+b.rad;
	if (dist>=rad*rad) {return;}
	dist=Math.sqrt(dist);
	norm/=dist;
	// Get relative masses.
	let mass=a.mass+b.mass;
	let amass=a.mass/mass;
	let bmass=b.mass/mass;
	// Get the relative velocity.
	let elasticity=1.98;
	let posdif=rad-dist;
	let veldif=norm*(a.vel-b.vel);          // correction
	veldif=max(veldif,0)*elasticity+posdif; // correction
	// Push the atoms apart.
	a.pos-=norm*(posdif*bmass);
	a.vel-=norm*(veldif*bmass);
	b.pos+=norm*(posdif*amass);
	b.vel+=norm*(veldif*amass);
}
</div>
<p>The choice to add <i>posdif</i> to the velocity came after a lot of trial and
error. Other attempts involved having a multiplier increase every time an atom
got hit, or increasing the relative mass of atoms lower to the ground. All of
these felt hackish, especially since some simulations might have multiple fields
of gravity. <i>posdif</i> was the simplest solution that offered decent results
and didn't blow up the simulation, so it's what I stuck with.</p>


<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Springs ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h1>Springs</h1>
<!--<h2>Springs</h2>-->
<p>Springs (called bonds) form the second half of creating solid objects in the
engine, so it's equally important that we get them right too. The standard
equations for springs follow
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law">Hooke's law</a>. Unlike
the early problems with atoms collapsing, applying Hooke's law results in
meshes that explode:</p>
<table class="demotable">
<tr><td></td>
<td style="width:40%;padding:1rem;">
<canvas id="osccanv4" style="margin:auto;"></canvas></td>
<td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>This is the pseudocode that implements Hooke's law as it's written:</p>
<div class="codeblock langjs">function applyspring() {
	// Compare atom distance.
	let a=this.a,b=this.b;
	let norm=b.pos-a.pos;
	let dist=Math.sqrt(norm*norm);
	norm/=dist;
	// Get relative masses.
	let mass=a.mass+b.mass;
	let amass=a.mass/mass;
	let bmass=b.mass/mass;
	// Push or pull the atoms.
	let force=norm*(this.dist-dist)*this.tension;
	a.acc-=force*bmass;
	b.acc+=force*amass;
}
// update all atoms after accumulating forces
</div>
<p>Once again, the infinitesimal timestep of the real world allows the
traditional spring equations to work. The mesh explosion results from the
engine accumulating all of the acceleration changes at once, and then applying
them all at once in a separate step. When the atoms are perfectly aligned,
forces stay in balance. But, because our simulation is a flawed world with large
timesteps and floating-point rounding, as soon as that balance is upset a
little, the corrective spring forces build up in one direction, and in the next
step build up in the other direction and so on.</p>
<p>The fix is to change when we apply the forces so that the springs naturally
moderate themselves. We'll modify the function to apply the acceleration when
the spring is evaluated instead of waiting to do it all at once, like so:</p>
<div class="codeblock langjs">// dt = our timestep. For 60 fps it would be 1/60.
let force=(rest_dist-dist)*tension;
pos+=force*dt*dt*0.5;
vel+=force*dt;
</div>
<p>Modifying the positions during evaluation prevents the forces from building
up. This results in a much more stable mesh.</p>
<table class="demotable">
<tr><td></td>
<td style="width:36%;padding:1rem;">
<canvas id="osccanv2" style="margin:auto;"></canvas></td>
<td style="width:36%;padding:1rem;">
<canvas id="osccanv3" style="margin:auto;"></canvas></td>
<td></td>
</tr><tr>
<td></td>
<td style="padding:1rem;padding-top:0;vertical-align:top"><i>acc += force</i>
<br><i style="visibility:hidden">pos += force * dt * dt * 0.5</i></td>
<td style="padding:1rem;padding-top:0;vertical-align:top">
<i>pos += force * dt * dt * 0.5<br>vel += force * dt</i></td>
<td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>The final corrected spring function is:</p>
<div class="codeblock langjs">function applyspring(dt) {
	// Compare atom distance to our target distance.
	let a=this.a,b=this.b;
	let norm=b.pos-a.pos;
	let dist=Math.sqrt(norm*norm);
	norm/=dist;
	// Get relative masses.
	let mass=a.mass+b.mass;
	let amass=a.mass/mass;
	let bmass=b.mass/mass;
	// Push or pull the atoms, with corrected forces.
	let force=(this.dist-dist)*this.tension;
	let veldif=force*dt;
	let posdif=force*dt*dt*0.5;
	a.pos-=norm*(posdif*bmass);
	a.vel-=norm*(veldif*bmass);
	b.pos+=norm*(posdif*amass);
	b.vel+=norm*(veldif*amass);
}
</div>
<p>Once meshes get large enough, however, forces can still build up
regardless.</p>
<table class="demotable">
<tr><td></td>
<td style="width:40%;padding:1rem;">
<canvas id="osccanv5" style="margin:auto;"></canvas></td>
<td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>The problem isn't really on the engine this time. It has to do with how
meshes are normally constructed. In the demo above, for example, we have two
loops that build the meshes from upper-left to bottom-right.</p>
<div class="codeblock langjs">for (let y=0;y&lt;mesh_height;y++) {
	for (let x=0;x&lt;mesh_width;x++) {
		// connect (x,y) with (x-1,y  )
		// connect (x,y) with (x  ,y-1)
		// connect (x,y) with (x-1,y-1)
		// connect (x,y) with (x+1,y-1)
	}
}
</div>
<p>When meshes are evaluated in an order like this, forces tend to build up in
one direction like a wave. The oscillations in the demo are always biased to one
corner if you watch closely.</p>
<p>We can fix this by randomizing the order we evaluate springs. Any
randomization will work, even if it's low quality. As long as the forces are
spread out then the mesh will stabilize.</p>
<table class="demotable">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td style="width:36%;padding:1rem;">
<canvas id="osccanv0" style="margin:auto;"></canvas></td>
<td style="width:36%;padding:1rem;">
<canvas id="osccanv1" style="margin:auto;"></canvas></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td style="padding:1rem;padding-top:0;">Static ordering</td>
<td style="padding:1rem;padding-top:0;">Random ordering</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</table>
<script>
new OscillationScene(["osccanv0","osccanv5"],0);
new OscillationScene(["osccanv1"],1);
new OscillationScene(["osccanv2","osccanv4"],2);
new OscillationScene(["osccanv3"],3);
</script>
<p>When figuring out how to stabilize the springs, updating the position
quickly became the obvious choice. The only problem was that choosing the
wrong multiplier created springs that were almost too stable. Boxes would
barely rotate when a corner was hit. After a lot of trial and error, I
eventually found that just unrolling the acceleration equations in the spring
function was enough to make things stable without any weird hacks or
multipliers.</p>


<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Broadphase ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h1>Broadphase</h1>
<!--<h2>Broadphase</h2>-->
<p>If you're driving a car in the U.S., you likely won't be worried about a car
making a left turn in China. Although humans can make this distinction easily, a
computer won't know to. Anything can collide with anything, even if they're far
away. So, if we have 1000 objects, then there will be about half a million pairs
of collisions we'll need to test - half a million for every single step of the
engine.</p>
<p>The broadphase step does the job of quickly determining which objects are
likely to collide and which ones aren't. An easy way to do this is to draw a
grid. If two objects overlap the same cell, check if they collide. This grid
scheme runs into problems with differently scaled objects though: a mountain
will take up millions of cells, while a mouse will take up one.</p>
<p>Our engine instead uses a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH), which looks like
this:</p>
<canvas id="bvhcanv" style="width:100%;height:200px;"></canvas>
<script>new BVHScene("bvhcanv");</script>
<p>This demo doesn't show the full hierarchy since it would be too messy, but
the algorithm works by subdividing the world into smaller and smaller boxes. We
first check if an object overlaps the top box. If it does then we check if it
overlaps any of its children until we get all the way down to an actual,
tangible object. The hard part of this scheme is deciding the best way to divide
up everything.</p>
<p>I decided to compare the different construction methods for evaluation time
and BVH quality. I've listed the performance values below, but without going
into the exact differences, the method I decided to go with involved:</p>
<table class="listtable">
<tr><td>1.</td><td>Pick a point in each object's AABB. I went with the minimum
vertex to keep things simple.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.</td><td>Compute a parent AABB containing all of these
points.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.</td><td>Find the axis with the largest <i>max[axis]-min[axis]</i> in
the parent AABB.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4.</td><td>Find the midpoint <i>(min[axis]+max[axis])/2</i> and split
objects by whether their AABBs are above or below this value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5.</td><td>Continue subdividing each side.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>I call this the center split method. Other common methods involve splitting
by surface area of the child AABBs, or sorting them by Morton codes and building
the tree from the bottom up.</p>
<p>The next thing to look at was traversing the BVH during collision checks. In
javascript, every array access is treated as an affront to god and punished just
as harshly, so anything that could help accesses would pay dividends. To speed
up traversal, we'll flatten the tree.</p>
<p>Flattening a tree involves rearranging it in memory so parents and siblings
are nearby to each other in physical memory. In our case, the tree was arranged
so the left child would immediately follow a parent. The right child would come
after the left child and all its children. This is what it looks like compared
to a tree arranged top to bottom in memory:</p>
<div class="consoleblock"> Top-to-bottom                Flattened

       1                          1
     .' '.                      .' '.  
   .'     '.                  .'     '.
  2         3                2         5
 / \       / \              / \       / \
4   5     6   7            3   4     6   7
</div>
<p>Notice that differences between <i>child - parent</i> values in the
top-to-bottom tree sum to 15, while it's only 11 in the flattened tree.</p>
<p>In the end flattening the tree resulted in an amazing 43% speed up.
Converting to webassembly was always slower no matter how I did it.</p>

<p>The important thing about the center split method is that it is <b>fast</b>.
It beat my previous broadphase algorithm (grid partitioning) by 23% while
being simpler, scaling to higher dimensions better, and being more useful for
queries.</p>


<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Drawing ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h1>Drawing</h1>
<!--<h2>Drawing</h2>-->
<p>Because I wanted to construct objects out of atoms, the problem arose with
how to render them accurately while also looking good. In minecraft, everything
is a block which ends up looking pleasing because they line up flush with each
other. With circles, there end up being annoying gaps no matter how they're
stacked.</p>
<p>The obvious solution is to keep the drawing separate from the physical
object, which quickly becomes untenable when the underlying atoms are deformed -
we would have to deform the drawing too. There are also fancy filling algorithms
I looked at but abandoned because they would be too complicated and slow.</p>
<p>The solution was to change how objects were constructed to allow overlapping
atoms if there was a bond between them. When rendering, if multiple atoms
overlap, pixels from the closest atom overwrite others. This allows straight
edges to form even when we're modeling everything with circles.</p>
<p>This is what the effect looks like in action:</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Notes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>I'm really happy with how the dynamics turned out. I've been working with
physics engines for a long time, and it was only recently that everything came
together to create an engine that's stable and also looks good.</p>
<p>The broadphase detection was also a long time coming. I used to use
grid-based detection because of its speed, and before that an algorithm that
would find the covariance of the points and split them along that vector. Only
after sitting down to try a dozen or so different types of BVH algorithms did I
find the center split method that is not only more functional than the grid, but
also faster.</p>
<p>I thought about making an engine with only atoms and modeling everything
with protons and electrons. That might come at another time. I don't know how
electrons stay stuck to protons if they're neutral...</p>
