<p>Steve, of the Care-point Hospital Share-bear Cheerleader Squad will be
leaving due to lack of Sharepoint.</p>
<p><i>"I was kind of confused. They said there was Sharepoint in the bear
outfit, but when I got in they just made me dance and run around. I lost a lot
of weight though."</i></p>
<p>When asked for his proudest achievement, he said:</p>
<p><i>"I designed the <b>Stay signed in?</b> Sharepoint prompt to ignore
whatever you pick. Stay signed in? Nah, stay mad idiot. Enjoy signing in
tomorrow."</i></p>
<p>He will be departing to a place with worse uniform requirements, but a better
Sharepoint environment... <i>for now</i></p>
