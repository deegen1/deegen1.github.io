<div class="content"><h1>Tetris AI</h1>
<p>The AI is available in python as <a href="./Tetris.py">Tetris.py</a> and can
be played in any terminal.</p>
<p>Pressing <i>I</i> will toggle modes.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Metrics ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h1>Metrics</h1>
<p>The AI uses a set of metrics that are computed from the tetris board. These
metrics are each given a weight and added together to give a board its fitness
score. The final set I used is shown below.</p>
<br>
<table class="datatable headerrow">
<tr><td>Metric</td><td>Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>sum holes</td><td>The count of all holes on the grid. A cell is a hole
if it is empty and a filled cell is above it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>sum height</td><td>The sum of the column heights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>row flip</td><td>The number of times neighboring cells flip between
empty and filled along a row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>column flip</td><td>The number of times neighboring cells flip between
empty and filled along a column.</td></tr>
<tr><td>piece height</td><td>The height of the top cell of the most recently
placed piece. Do not take into account line clears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>sum well</td><td>The sum of squared well heights. A well is an opening 1
cell wide, which happens to function as a chokepoint.</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>The AI maps out all possible moves it can make (with the option to add
human-like lag), and records the final board states with their scores. The AI
then backtracks from these final states to generate a map of the most optimal
move to make given any position on the board.</p>
<br>
<p>If a new piece is spawned, or the board changes, then a new move map is
generated. At each frame, the AI looks at the current piece position, looks at
the map it has made, and can immediately see what move to make next.</p>
<br>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.colinfahey.com/tetris/tetris.html">Colin
Fahey's</a> metrics as a starting point and created a bunch of my own. I then
set about finding the minimum set of metrics that yielded good performance.</p>
<br>
<p>Finding the set of optimal weights was difficult, mostly because their
performance couldn't be predicted or approximated. The AI had to play several
games with the weights to get their average performance. The performance of
weights was also very jagged and full of local minima. For that reason, I used
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization">particle
swarm optimization</a> and added the ability for a particle to randomly reset
itself if it became stuck.</p>
<br>
<p>When I had settled on the final set of metrics and weights, the AI was able
to clear 19,032,064 lines before I forced it to terminate. During that time, it
totally cleared the board 23,588 times.</p>
